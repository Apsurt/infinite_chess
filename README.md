# Quasar Chess Engine

Welcome to the Quasar Chess Engine repository! This project aims to develop a chess engine capable of playing on an infinite chessboard. Traditional chess is played on an 8x8 board, but this engine extends the concept to allow for virtually limitless board sizes.

## Features

(Everything WIP for now)

- **Infinite Board**: Play chess on a theoretically infinite board.
- **Standard Chess Rules**: Follows the standard rules of chess.
- **Chess Engine**: Implements a chess engine capable of generating moves and evaluating positions.
- **User Interface (UI)**: Basic user interface for interacting with the engine.
